	    	-------------Key Properties of Interface:--------------

		 1) The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
		 2) By default, variables in an interface are public, static, and final.
		 3) It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
		 4) It supports loose coupling (classes depend on behavior, not implementation).
		 5) In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other classes must implement.
		 6) An interface in Java defines a set of behaviors that a class can implement, 
		 usually representing an IS-A relationship, but not always in every scenario.*/
