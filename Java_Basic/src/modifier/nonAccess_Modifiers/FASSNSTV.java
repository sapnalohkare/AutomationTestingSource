	/*
	 * F ---> Final -> it restrict the access into another class
	 *    		   
	 *    		   1) final Variable :-> to create constant variable and it value can not be change. 
	 *  
	 * 			   2) final Method :->prevent method overriding
	 * 
	 * 			   3) final Class :->Prevent inheritance or can not extend it
	 * 
	 * 		
	 * A ---> Abstract -> it does not allow to create object of the class
	 * 
	 *   1)Abstract class :  can not create object --> have concrete(Instance and static methods) , variable(static and instance)
	 *   2)Abstract method : can not have body  
	 * 
	 * S ---> Static -> * we need to create object to access instance variable or method in static method.
	 * 					* cant declare static variable inside method
	 * 				 
	 *   			1) Static variables : does not need object to call in method or in constructor
	 *              2) Static methods   : does not need  object to call in static as well as static methods or in constructor
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * S ---> Strictfp -> 
	 *					
	 *					1) Strictfp class and method : to get same floating point decimal output on every (16,64,32 bit system)
	 * 
	 * N ---> Native ->
	 *   			
	 *   				1) Native method :  can not  add implementation in the body.even after inheritance 
	 *   				we can not  add implementation details 
	 *				    2)ts body is replaced by a semicolon, and the actual implementation is provided in a separate, 
	 *				    native libraryts body is replaced by a semicolon, 
	 *				    and the actual implementation is provided in a separate, native library
	 * 
	 * S ---> synchronized -> 
	 *              
	 *                 1) synchronized method and block : Methods can only be accessed by one thread or object at a time
	 *              
	 * 
	 * 
	 * T ---> Transient -> 
	 * 
	 *    				1) Transient variable : stores default value of data type of variable
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * V ---> Volatile -> 
	 * 
	 *                  1) Volatile variable :  The volatile keyword makes sure that threads always update the 
	 *                     						value of an attribute in main memory.
	 *    
	 *
