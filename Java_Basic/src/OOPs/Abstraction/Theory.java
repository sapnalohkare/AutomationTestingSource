	/*In object oriented programming, abstraction is defined as hiding the unnecessary 
    details (implementation) from the user and to focus on essential details (functionality)*/
	
	
	/* 1) can not create object of abstract class 
	 * 2) method and class can be abstract 
	 * 3) but variable can not be abstract
	 * 4) Abstract method can be in abstract class only
	 * 5) Abstract class can have instance method
	 * 6) Abstract class can have static method
	 * 7) instance and static method together calls concrete method
	 * 8) can not  create object of abstract class
	 * 9) abstract class can extend abstract class
	 * 10) no constructor is provided, an abstract class has a default constructor. 
	    An abstract class can also include user-defined constructors.
	 * 11) Creating more than one constructor is permitted in an abstract class.
	 * 12)if a single method is abstract then that class need to declare as an abstract class
	 * 
	 * 13)Syntax for abstract method: abstract return_type method_name( [ argument-list ] );  
	 * 14)illegal combinations for abstract methods
	 * 
	    * 1)final
		* 2)abstract native
		* 3)abstract synchronized
		* 4)abstract static
		* 5)abstract private
		* 6)abstract strictfp
	 * 
	 * 15)It can have constructors and static methods also.
	 * 16)It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
	 * 17)those classes which extends abstract class called concrete class
	 * 
	 * 
	 *  --------------Key features of Abstract Classes---------
	 * 1)Abstract Methods:
	 * 2)Concrete Methods: 
	 * 3)Cannot be Instantiated:
	 * 4)Can have default , User defined and parameterized Constructors:
