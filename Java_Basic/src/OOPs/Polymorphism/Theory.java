	/* ----------Key features of polymorphism:-----------------------
	 * 
	 * 1)Multiple Behaviors: 
	 *       	The same method can behave differently depending on the object that calls this method.
	 * 2)Method Overriding: (Runtime polymorphism)
	 * 			A child class can redefine a method of its parent class.
	 * 3)Method Overloading:(compile time polymorphism)
	 * 			 We can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
	 * 4) Runtime Decision:
	 * 			 At runtime, Java determines which method to call depending on the objectâ€™s actual class.

	 * ---------------Types of Polymorphism in Java-------------------
	 * 
	 * 1)Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static)
	 *	    : 1)Method Overloading
	 *	
	 * 2)Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic)
  	 *		: 1)method Overriding
  	 *		: 2) Vertual functions
	 * 
	 * 
	 *   Dog d1=new Dog();  Static Binding (also known as Early Binding).
	 *        when the object is determined at compile time then its know as static binding.
	 *        
	 * Animal d = dog(); Dynamic Binding (also known as Late Binding)
	 *   		when the object is determined at run time it is known as dynamic binding.
